* **day01**: Contains a program `helloworld.py` that prints "Hello World!"
* **day02**: Contains `circle.py` and `rectangle.py` that print the area and circumference/perimeter of the shapes when prompted for their required parameters
* **day03**: Contains the following:
1. Scripts named `circle_user.py` and `rectangle_user.py` which calculate the area and circumference/perimeter like the scripts in **day02**, but now instead take values directly from the command line. \
   These can be executed by running the following command in any terminal (Command Prompt for Windows, Terminal for Linux, equivalent for Mac, provided Python is installed in the system): \
       ```ruby
       python <working-directory>\circle_user.py <radius>
       ```
   or \
   ```ruby
   python <working-directory>\rectangle_user.py <height> <width>
   ```
