### List of contents

* **day01**: Contains a program `helloworld.py` that prints "Hello World!"
* **day02**: Contains `circle.py` and `rectangle.py` that print the area and circumference/perimeter of the shapes when prompted for their required parameters
* **day03**: Contains the following:
1. Scripts `circle_user.py` and `rectangle_user.py` that calculate the area and circumference/perimeter like the scripts in **day02**, but now instead take values directly from the command line. \
   These can be executed by running the following command in any terminal (Command Prompt for Windows, Terminal for Linux, equivalent for Mac, provided Python is installed in the system): 
   ```ruby
   python <working-directory>\circle_user.py <radius>
   ```
   or
   ```ruby
   python <working-directory>\rectangle_user.py <height> <width>
   ```
2. Script `number_guessing_game_0.py`, wherein the user tries to guess a number the computer thinks up between 1 and 20. The user is told if their guess was greater or smaller than the guess (and by how much), or if their guess was correct.

* **day04**: Contains 7 scripts `number_guessing_game_0-6.py` in accordance to the [number guessing game exercise](https://slides.code-maven.com/python/exercise-number-guessing-game.html)
